See Readme.txt for the ArgyllCMS upstream file.

To build this, do the following:

wget http://www.argyllcms.com/Argyll_V1.3.6_src.zip
unzip Argyll_V1.3.6_src.zip
cp Argyll_V1.3.6/* . -Ru
patch -p1 < contrib/no-comments-in-yajl-upstream.patch
patch -p1 < contrib/disable-ucmm-as-no-yajl.patch
./autogen.sh
make
make distcheck

Voila! You should now have a tarball that can be used without using jam.
